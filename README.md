# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company that needs to forcast the number of employees that will be retiring in order to understand staffing needs in the near future.  All of the employee data is in CSV files.  We are tasked with helping the HR Analyst create a SQL database with all of the different CSV's containing employee data.  Once the database is created, we must do an analysis to determine how many employeess are up for retirement.

### Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


### Summary: 
* Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
